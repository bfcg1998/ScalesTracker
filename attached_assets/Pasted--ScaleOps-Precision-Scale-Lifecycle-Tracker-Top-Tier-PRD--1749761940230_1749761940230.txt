ScaleOps — Precision Scale Lifecycle Tracker (Top-Tier PRD)
===========================================================

📌 Purpose
----------
ScaleOps is a secure, mobile-optimized application built for the United States Air Force and other defense units to manage high-precision weighing scales. It ensures operational readiness, calibration compliance, asset accountability, and seamless chain-of-custody tracking — even in offline environments. Built to scale with military-grade security and audit capabilities.

🎯 Objectives
-------------
- Enforce full asset accountability with audit logs  
- Prevent expired/overdue scales from field assignment  
- Simulate fair-use rotation to extend asset life  
- Provide command-level visibility and reporting  
- Operate in offline, field-deployed environments  

🛠️ Key Features
----------------

🔐 Secure Authentication & Access
- DoD ID login with future support for CAC/PIV validation  
- Role-based access: Admin, Technician, Auditor, Viewer  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA-ready)
- User access logs with timestamps and IP/device fingerprinting

🧰 Scale Lifecycle & Assignment Management
- Manage 36+ precision scale units  
- Assign/return workflow with:
  - Date, user, unit, condition, and location tracking  
- Prevent assignment of:
  - Expired calibration  
  - Calibrations expiring within next 30 days  
- Track full history: chain-of-custody for each unit  
- Set calibration cycles (default: 2 years)  
- Flag for inspection, deactivation, or scheduled maintenance  
- Smart rotation logic to balance asset usage evenly  

📊 Dashboard & Operational Reporting
- Quick-glance KPIs:
  - Total units / Expiring / Expired / In-field  
  - Average usage interval / Underused units  
- Generate and export:
  - CSV, JSON, PDF reports
  - Chain-of-custody logs
- Email-ready summaries for CO review

🔔 Notifications & Alerts
- Admin-configurable alerts:
  - 30/15/7-day calibration warnings  
  - Overdue returns  
  - Repeated assignment to same unit  
- In-app and email notifications (with offline queuing)  

🔍 Search, Filter, and Bulk Actions
- Filter by:
  - Calibration status, last assignment, unit, user  
- Bulk assign/return  
- Tagging system for asset grouping  
- Export filtered results to CSV

🧑‍💼 User Role Definitions
| Role      | Permissions |
|-----------|-------------|
| Admin     | Full control, user management, reports |
| Technician | Assign/return, calibrate, view logs |
| Auditor   | View all logs, generate reports |
| Viewer    | Read-only dashboard and asset view |

📱 UX & Mobile Optimization
- Mobile-first design, responsive for tablet and desktop  
- Intuitive interface with gesture support  
- Dark mode, large-tap areas, haptic/audio feedback  
- View delays for smoother transitions  

⚙️ Offline + Syncing
- Full offline support via SQLite / local storage  
- Background sync when network is available  
- Optional DoD-compliant cloud backup + sync (e.g. AWS GovCloud, MilCloud)

📡 Integration & Extensibility
- Future API for importing from DoD supply systems (NSN, DoDAAC)  
- REST endpoint for audit consumption  
- Modular structure for adding equipment beyond scales  

🧠 AI/ML (Advanced Option)
- Predictive calibration failure based on past data  
- Usage optimization suggestions (e.g. redistribute underused assets)  
- Auto-flagging suspicious activity (reassigning to same user frequently)

🧪 Success Criteria
-------------------
- ✅ App installs and runs without issue across iOS, Android, and Web  
- ✅ Fully operational offline with eventual cloud sync  
- ✅ Admin can register/manage users securely  
- ✅ Users can assign, return, and view full scale logs  
- ✅ No expired scales assigned in test cycles  
- ✅ 100% audit logs traceable for any event in system  
- ✅ Predictive calibration tested with >80% accuracy on sample data
